Serialization and De-Serialization using Java Reflection

Two Java classes MyAllTypesFirst and MyAllTypesSecond are designed with the data members having their names and types as given in serialized format in the text file MyAllTypes. This MyAllTypes text file is then parsed and deserialized to create MyAllTypesFirst and MyAllTypesSecond objects. Reflection is used to create the object depending on the value in the complexType element of the given MyAllTypes text file. The names of the data members are parsed and the corresponding setX methods are invoked to set the value for that data member. Then all MyAllTypesFirst and MyAllTypesSecond objects are compared and unique objects of both types are reported. In Serialize class, serializeObject() method takes a Java object and serializes it using the serialization protocol shown in MyAllTypes text file. All objects created by parsing the MyAllTypes text file are serialized and then stored in a new text file MyAllTypesCopy. Running a diff between MyAllTypes and MyAllTypesCopy text files does not show any difference.
